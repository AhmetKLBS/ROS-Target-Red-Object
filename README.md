# ROS-Target-Red-Object
In this code file, using the camera and Lidar sensor, the robot detects the red object with the camera and measures the distance of the surrounding objects with the Lidar sensor and goes to the red object in the shortest way. Using distance data from the camera, the robot stops at the desired distance from the obstacle.
